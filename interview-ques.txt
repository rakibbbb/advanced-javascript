1. What is the difference between null and undefined.
2. What is the difference between double equal and triple equal.
Ans: When we put double equal, then program will check only the value. 
    If we put the triple equal, then program will check the value and the type of value.
    Ex: const num1 = 3;
        const num2 = '3';
        if(num1 == num2){
            console.log("Condition is true.");
        }
        else{
            console.log("Condition is false.");
        }
    Here, output will be Condition is true. It only check the value.

    const num1 = 3;
        const num2 = '3';
        if(num1 === num2){
            console.log("Condition is true.");
        }
        else{
            console.log("Condition is false.");
        }
    Here, output will be Condition is false. It was check the value and the value type. so it show's false.

3. What is hoisting?
Ans: Variable hoisting means the JavaScript engine moves the variable declarations to the top of the script.

4. What is block scope?
Ans: A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

5. What is global scope?
Ans: A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.
Any variable declared outside of the function belongs to the global scope.
