1. What is the difference between null and undefined.
2. What is the difference between double equal and triple equal.
Ans: When we put double equal, then program will check only the value. 
    If we put the triple equal, then program will check the value and the type of value.
    Ex: const num1 = 3;
        const num2 = '3';
        if(num1 == num2){
            console.log("Condition is true.");
        }
        else{
            console.log("Condition is false.");
        }
    Here, output will be Condition is true. It only check the value.

    const num1 = 3;
        const num2 = '3';
        if(num1 === num2){
            console.log("Condition is true.");
        }
        else{
            console.log("Condition is false.");
        }
    Here, output will be Condition is false. It was check the value and the value type. so it show's false.
